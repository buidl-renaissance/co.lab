# Co.Lab

Co.Lab is a voice-first project planning tool for creative teams. Transform freeform conversations into structured, actionable project plans.

## About

At Co.Lab, we believe that the best ideas come from natural conversations. Our mission is to bridge the gap between free-flowing discussions and structured project management, making it easier for teams to capture, organize, and act on their collaborative ideas.

## Features

- **Talk It Out**: Capture your collaborative conversations naturally, without interrupting your creative flow.
- **We Structure It**: Our AI automatically organizes your ideas into tasks, timelines, and action items.
- **You Build Together**: Share the structured plan, assign tasks, and track progress as a team.
